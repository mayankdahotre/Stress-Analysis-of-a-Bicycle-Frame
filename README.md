### These ANSYS files conatians the Static Structural stress analysis of a Bicycle Frame and it's modified version for better endurance and stability for max stress compenstaion and min deformation 

### This was a part of a project of a course of Integrated Design and Manufacturing in which we had to come up wiht a innovative modified design of an existing design of a tool to solve the problem based on increasing the efficiency and improving the parameters of the new design
